# Is The American Dream Dead?
As a lifelong American, I set out to address the question: *"Is the American Dream dead?"* This study aims to offer a clear analysis of the perspectives across multiple generations, examining how factors such as cost of living and crime rates have shifted over time, and exploring why so many individuals today feel a sense of hopelessness.


## **Abstract**

The notion of the American Dream, once symbolizing the promise of opportunity and prosperity for all, has come under intense scrutiny in recent years. This research paper explores the question of whether the American Dream is still attainable, with a particular focus on the perspectives of younger generations who seem increasingly disillusioned with the idea. The study aims to uncover not only the reasons behind the growing skepticism, but also to examine the possibility of revival, the underlying causes of its decline, and the psychological impact of this widespread doubt. Through a comprehensive analysis of current economic trends, including financial instability, rising crime rates, unaffordable housing, and the challenges posed by globalization, the paper reveals a multitude of factors contributing to the erosion of the American Dream. Additional concerns such as massive job layoffs, outsourcing, corporate greed, political corruption, and growing inequality further exacerbate the sense of hopelessness felt by many. The loss of educational quality, social fragmentation, stagnant wages, and pervasive government intervention are also key factors. Ultimately, this research highlights the urgent need for a reassessment of economic and political structures to restore hope and opportunity to those who have been left behind in today's economy.


## **Introduction**

#### Background:
The concept of the "American Dream" is central to the cultural and societal ideal in the United States. It is the belief that through hard work and determination anyone can achieve success. It's rooted in the nation's founding principles and is closely tied to the idea of freedom, opportunity, and self-determination.

However, over the years, the reality of achieving this dream has been increasingly questioned, especially by newer generations. Economic inequality, rising student debt, stagnating wages, and crime have led many to reconsider whether the American Dream is still achievable. For some, the dream of financial stability, homeownership, and social mobility is becoming more elusive.

#### Research Problem and Objective: 
I intend to explore the perspectives of multiple generations of Americans, examining how factors such as cost of living, crime rates, wages, and more, have evolved over time, and investigating why so many people today feel a sense of hopelessness. The central question guiding this study is: "Is the American Dream dead?" By examining various factors such as: income inequality, education access, employment opportunities, and generational wealth. This study seeks to evaluate whether the ideals of the American Dream remain achievable for most Americans today.

#### Research Questions and Hypotheses:

##### Research Questions:
- How do economic factors, including housing costs, grocery expenses, take-home pay (adjusted for inflation), higher education costs, healthcare expenses, overall cost of living, stagnant wages, and shrinkflation, influence a generation's perception of the American Dream?
- How do stability factors, such as mental illness rates, single-parent households, income inequality, trust in government, employment opportunities, college enrollment rates, and immigration trends, impact individuals' views on the American Dream?
- How do crime rates, including gun violence, overall crime, and school shootings, social unrest or protests, affect perceptions of the American Dream?

##### Hypotheses:
- Generations that grew up in periods of greater economic growth will have a more positive view of the American Dream compared to those who experienced economic decline or stagnation.
- Higher crime rates and social instability are correlated with a decreased belief in the attainability of the American Dream, particularly among younger generations.
- Younger generations (i.e., Millennials and Gen Z) are more likely to express feelings of hopelessness regarding the American Dream due to factors such as student debt, limited job opportunities, and economic inequality.

#### Purpose of the Study: 
The purpose of this study is to explore how socio-economic and stability factors influence public perceptions of the American Dream. By analyzing the evolution of these factors over time, this study aims to provide a deeper understanding of why many individuals today believe the American Dream is no longer attainable. Ultimately, this research seeks not only to identify the reasons behind the loss of hope but also to inspire renewed belief in the possibility of achieving the American Dream.

#### Thesis Statement:
So, is the American Dream dead? After extensive research, I argue that while the American Dream is not dead, it is on life support and at risk of dying if we fail to take action and implement positive change. By acknowledging the pressing issues facing this country, we can begin to combat the challenges undermining our society. These issues range from the widening income gap between lower, middle, and upper classes, to the escalating costs of life-saving healthcare, to rising crime rates, among many others. The goal of this study is to clearly identify _what_ is happening and _why_ it is happening (e.g., the link between increasing mental illness and the rise in school shootings). Through collective effort and reform, we can address these problems and rebuild what was once a hallmark of American prosperity.


## **Literature Review**

#### Overview of Existing Research: 
Current research indicates that the financial requirements to achieve the American Dream are increasingly out of reach for many individuals, and the situation only appears to be worsening. One report highlights that the cost of achieving the American Dream today exceeds the lifetime earnings of most Americans by over $1 million - without even accounting for essential expenses such as food, healthcare, and auto insurance. This raises significant concerns, especially for younger generations entering the workforce, including those currently in college.

In their study, _The College Payoff: More Education Doesn’t Always Mean More Earnings_, the authors note that the typical U.S. worker with a bachelor's degree is estimated to earn around $2.8 million over their career. However, the report also emphasizes that higher education does not always correlate with higher earnings. Specifically, 31% of workers with only a high school diploma earn more than half of workers with an associate’s degree. Additionally, 28% of those with an associate’s degree earn more than half of those with a bachelor’s, and 38% of individuals with a bachelor’s degree earn more than half of those with a master’s.

When it comes to retirement, the financial expectations are equally daunting. According to a report by Investopedia, the recommended minimum savings for households aged 65 and above is approximately $1.6 million. This amount would allow for annual withdrawals of 4%, adjusted for a 2.5% inflation rate, over a 20-year period.

However, the reality of retirement savings in the U.S. falls drastically short of this target. The Federal Reserve’s 2023 Survey of Consumer Finances found that only about 54% of American families even have a retirement account, and the median value of those accounts is a mere $86,900.

How do people feel about the American Dream? Not great. A 2024 analysis by ABC News and Ipsos found that only about 25% of Americans still believe in the concept of "if you work hard, you'll get ahead." For context, this figure was 50% just 13 years ago. Specifically, only 27% of those surveyed said they still believe in the American Dream, a significant drop from 50% in 2010. 52% of people today feel that while the American Dream was once achievable, it no longer is today.

In conclusion, the existing research underscores a troubling trend: the financial prerequisites for achieving the American Dream are increasingly out of reach for many, particularly for younger generations. With rising costs, stagnant wages, and limited access to essential resources like education and retirement savings, a growing number of Americans feel that upward mobility is no longer attainable. This widespread sense of disenchantment, highlighted by the decline in belief in the American Dream, calls for further investigation into the underlying causes and potential solutions to restore hope and opportunity for all.


#### Theoretical Framework:
Several theories have been proposed by economists, politicians, and philosophers over the years to explain the downward trend in hope. Below are some of the most impactful theories, which I believe play a significant role in understanding this shift.

***Social Mobility Theory*** suggests that a society's success is measured by the extent to which individuals can achieve upward mobility. In the context of the American Dream, it highlights how systemic barriers, such as economic inequality and limited opportunities, hinder this mobility for certain groups.

***Economic Inequality and Structuralism*** emphasize the role of social structures and institutional factors in perpetuating disparities in wealth and opportunities. These theories argue that rising income inequality, stagnant wages, and limited access to resources restrict individuals' ability to achieve the American Dream.

***Theories of Crime and Social Disorder***, such as strain theory and social disorganization theory, propose that societal instability, including rising crime rates, undermines social mobility and disrupts individuals' belief in achieving success. These factors contribute to a perception of diminished opportunities for upward movement.

***Psychological Theories of Hope and Learned Helplessness*** explain how repeated failures and the perception of unattainable goals can lead to feelings of powerlessness and hopelessness. These theories suggest that individuals may internalize these experiences, reducing their belief in the possibility of achieving the American Dream.

One of the most impactful theories in today's context is **learned helplessness**, which I believe is particularly relevant to current societal challenges. According to this theory, individuals begin to feel powerless when they repeatedly encounter situations where their actions seem to have no effect on their outcomes, leading to a state of resignation. In today's society, this concept is especially concerning as it suggests that people may surrender to oppression rather than resist.

The Second Amendment was designed to protect citizens against a tyrannical government, to preserve liberty, and to guard against systemic oppression. However, many argue that, in the modern age, we face unprecedented levels of oppression - not only from governmental overreach but also from powerful, unregulated corporations. These entities, along with media and government propaganda, contribute to shaping public perceptions, often creating a sense of helplessness in younger generations. The constant bombardment of messages suggesting that individuals are too small or insignificant to fight back might lead to a belief that the only way to survive is to comply. This creates a cycle in which individuals remain passive, exploited for cheap labor, while the larger corporate and governmental systems continue to thrive at their expense.

#### Gaps in Literature: 
One key gap identified in the literature is the lack of effective visualization. While numerous studies examine the factors contributing to the decline of the American Dream, much of the information is presented in text-heavy formats. For the average person, reading through extensive papers can be overwhelming. A concise and impactful visualization could make a significant difference in helping individuals better understand and identify the issues causing the loss of hope for the future. By offering a visual representation of these challenges, it becomes easier to grasp the differences and implications, potentially inspiring action and greater awareness.

Another important area that is often overlooked is the impact of advancements in technology and automation on job loss and job security. As technology continues to evolve, its role in reshaping the workforce and contributing to a sense of economic instability deserves more attention in relation to the American Dream.

Additionally, there is limited research on the effects of globalization on the labor market and its influence on the perception of the American Dream. The movement of jobs overseas, wage stagnation, and increased global competition have profound effects on Americans' belief in their ability to succeed. I hope to be able to provide more research to explore how these global shifts have altered public perceptions of opportunity and upward mobility.


## **Methodology**

#### Data Collection and Analysis:
To gather data for this study, I explored various publicly available online sources, including Statista, Kaggle, Datahub, and other independent platforms (referenced in the _References_ section). From these sources, I identified 16 relevant datasets. However, gaps in the existing literature prompted me to conduct interviews with 57 individuals in my local area to supplement the available data. I then utilized tools such as Python, Pandas, Tableau, and Microsoft Excel to clean, prepare, validate, and visualize the data.


## **Results**

#### Findings: 

***Housing crisis*** <br>
The housing crisis in the United States has grown increasingly severe over the past several decades, making it even harder for many Americans to achieve the dream of homeownership. The 2008 financial crash exposed the fragility of the housing market, and while the market has rebounded in some areas, the affordability crisis has only deepened. Home prices have escalated far beyond the rate of wage growth, especially in major metropolitan areas like San Francisco, New York City, and Los Angeles. The price of a median home in the U.S. has more than doubled since the early 2000s, leaving many middle and lower income Americans struggling to afford a place to live. In urban centers where job opportunities are concentrated, the lack of affordable housing has forced many individuals and families to settle for subpar living conditions, or to rent for much longer than they ever anticipated, pushing the prospect of homeownership further out of reach.

Furthermore, the affordability gap has worsened due to a shortage of new, affordable housing being built. Developers have focused on high-end, luxury housing to maximize profit margins, while affordable housing development has lagged behind, contributing to growing homelessness and housing insecurity. A report from the National Low Income Housing Coalition in 2023 revealed that in no state could someone working full-time at minimum wage afford a two-bedroom apartment at fair market rent. This housing disparity has hit particularly hard for low-income and minority communities, who are often priced out of desirable neighborhoods and forced into overcrowded, less safe areas. With housing costs continuing to rise while wages stagnate, the dream of owning a home—a symbol of financial security and upward mobility—seems increasingly unattainable for many Americans. The housing crisis, much like the outsourcing of jobs, underscores the growing divide between the wealthy and the rest of the population, diminishing the American Dream for large swaths of the population.

***Outsourcing of US jobs*** <br>
The outsourcing of American jobs has been a significant factor in the decline of the American Dream over the past few decades. As multinational companies seek to maximize profits by relocating production to countries with lower labor costs, at our expense. Because of this, millions of American workers in industries like manufacturing, textiles, and call centers have lost their jobs. Between the 1990s and early 2000s, trade policies like the North American Free Trade Agreement made it easier for U.S. companies to move jobs abroad. This trend has not only reduced the availability of well-paying jobs but has also driven down wages for many workers who remain in the job market. In particular, factory jobs, once the backbone of the middle class, have been outsourced to countries like China, India, and Mexico, leaving many Americans struggling to find stable, high-paying employment. For those who have been displaced by outsourcing, transitioning to new industries has often been challenging, particularly for older workers who may not have the skills or resources to retrain.

Over the years, the consequences of outsourcing have only worsened. Entire communities that were once dependent on industries like steel production, textiles, and electronics have faced mass unemployment and economic decay. For example, cities like Detroit, which once thrived on automobile manufacturing, saw their economies collapse after major companies moved production to cheaper labor markets. While outsourcing has contributed to lower prices for consumers and greater global efficiency, the downsides for American workers have been immense. The outsourcing of jobs has exacerbated income inequality and made it increasingly difficult for many people to achieve economic mobility. As manufacturing jobs continue to disappear, the American Dream of achieving success through hard work and perseverance seems increasingly out of reach for a growing segment of the population.

***Fear and Risks of Globalization*** <br>
The rise of globalization has emerged as a central factor in the belief that the American Dream has been undermined. The outsourcing of jobs and the decline of domestic manufacturing have contributed to financial instability for many Americans. Additionally, small businesses, which have long been a cornerstone of the U.S. economy, are increasingly struggling to compete with the mass production capabilities of multinational corporations. The dominance of these corporations in the real estate market has exacerbated the housing crisis, with skyrocketing property prices and rental costs leaving many Americans questioning how they can afford to live.

Despite the widespread concern surrounding globalization, there remains a notable lack of comprehensive information available online about the risks it poses and the public’s perception of these issues. In an effort to better understand public sentiment, I conducted extensive research, including a review of social media platforms and personal interviews with 57 individuals from my local area. The findings were overwhelmingly negative, with a significant portion of respondents expressing concerns about various aspects of globalization. Commonly cited issues included: job losses and economic displacement, cultural takeover, environmental degradation, loss of national sovereignty, and the growing influence of corporate power.

Several key entities are often identified as driving the forces of globalization. These include multinational corporations, international financial institutions, political and global elites, and media organizations. One of the most significant ways in which multinational corporations have impacted the American Dream is through the outsourcing of jobs, often taking advantage of low-wage and sometimes even slave labor in developing countries. This practice has not only contributed to job losses but has also led to a decline in wages and job security for many American workers.

International financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, have faced criticism for promoting economic reforms that prioritize debt repayment over social welfare or sustainable economic development. These reforms are often implemented in exchange for loans, with negative consequences for local economies. Political elites and governments, by promoting deregulation and open-market policies to attract foreign investment, have frequently prioritized economic growth at the expense of local industries, workers, and the environment. Lastly, media organizations, particularly those based in Western countries, have played a role in promoting the values of consumerism and individualism, often reinforcing the agenda of the global elites who control these outlets.

***Increasing Crime Rates*** <br>
Over the past few decades, rising crime rates in many American cities have contributed to the decline of the American Dream, eroding the sense of safety and security that once characterized many communities. The increase in violent crimes, property crimes, and drug-related offenses has made it more difficult for many Americans to achieve a stable and prosperous life. In cities like Chicago, Detroit, and Baltimore, crime rates have surged, leading to widespread fear and a decreased quality of life for residents. Several factors contribute to this rise in crime, including unregulated immigration, lack of access to quality education, and underinvestment in community resources.

Furthermore, the rise in crime has strained local law enforcement and emergency services, diverting resources away from other critical community needs. As crime continues to increase, it becomes harder for residents to feel secure, making it more difficult to build a stable, prosperous life. Communities plagued by higher crime rates often face declining property values, which further destabilize the local economy and reduce opportunities for financial growth. In these areas, the pursuit of a better life becomes a constant battle against crime and the dangers that come with it. For many, the dream of achieving stability, safety, and success feels increasingly out of reach as crime becomes a pervasive threat to their everyday lives.

Women, particularly, have increasingly become the targets of violent crimes, including rape and assault. A significant factor contributing to this surge may be attributed to the social norms and ideologies that some individuals bring with them upon immigration. Historically, certain underdeveloped regions, particularly in South Asia and Africa, have exhibited patterns of oppression against women. In some Middle Eastern countries, women are still viewed as second-class citizens, with laws making them unable to speak in public or pursue an education. Furthermore, forced child marriages, often involving the payment of a dowry by the groom to the bride’s family, remain prevalent in some areas. These practices are reminiscent of modern-day slavery and serve to perpetuate deeply ingrained sexist ideologies.

As individuals from these regions immigrate to more developed nations, they bring these harmful ideologies with them, creating challenges in terms of integration and cultural assimilation. The persistence of these beliefs can pose significant risks, as they fail to recognize the autonomy and rights of women, fostering an environment where violence and exploitation are more likely to occur. Data indicates a correlation between rising immigration rates and an increase in certain crimes, suggesting that these cultural clashes may contribute to the growing incidence of violence against women and children.

***Growing Unaffordability of Quality Education*** <br>
The increasing unaffordability of quality education has become a significant barrier for many individuals seeking to secure a stable and prosperous future. As tuition costs for colleges and universities continue to rise, more and more students are finding it increasingly difficult to afford higher education, which is often seen as the key to accessing better job opportunities and economic mobility. For those who are unable to afford college, the pathway to securing a well-paying job becomes substantially narrower. Without a degree, many individuals are left with limited job options, typically in low-wage and low-security positions, which further perpetuate cycles of poverty.

This growing financial barrier has had a profound effect on how people view their future. Many young individuals, especially from lower-income backgrounds, are now faced with the harsh reality that a college education may be out of reach. As a result, aspirations of achieving the American Dream—success through hard work and education—are becoming increasingly distant. This sense of hopelessness has led to widespread feelings of frustration and disillusionment, as people realize that without access to higher education, they are unlikely to secure the kind of jobs that would allow them to build a stable future. Consequently, the rising cost of education has not only exacerbated economic inequality but has also dampened the outlook for many individuals, leaving them questioning how they can ever break free from the financial constraints they face.

***The Great Dividing of our Nation*** <br>
Western media has played a significant role in deepening divisions within society, often amplifying existing tensions and creating new ones. Through selective reporting, sensationalism, and the constant framing of issues in a way that pits different groups against each other, media outlets have fostered a polarized environment. By focusing heavily on topics like political affiliation, race, and social issues, media platforms have contributed to the perception of a "us vs. them" mentality, making it increasingly difficult for people to see beyond their differences. Social media, in particular, has magnified this effect by spreading misinformation, creating echo chambers, and reinforcing pre-existing biases, which only further isolates individuals and communities from one another.

The constant cycle of divisive narratives in the media has caused widespread distrust and animosity between different segments of the population. Whether it's exaggerating political conflicts, sensationalizing racial tensions, or framing social issues in polarizing terms, the result has been a fragmented society where people often see one another as enemies rather than fellow citizens. This media-driven division has eroded the collective sense of unity and cooperation, making it harder to address common challenges. Rather than engaging in constructive dialogue or finding common ground, many individuals are increasingly trapped in a cycle of division, driven by a media landscape that profits from conflict and discord. This fragmentation undermines the potential for social cohesion, further damaging the nation’s ability to work together toward solutions for its problems.

***Conclusion*** <br>
The American Dream, once symbolizing the potential for anyone to achieve prosperity through hard work and determination, has become increasingly out of reach for many Americans due to a variety of systemic issues. The housing crisis, exacerbated by escalating home prices and insufficient affordable housing, has left large portions of the population struggling to secure a stable place to live, further deepening economic divides. Similarly, the outsourcing of American jobs, facilitated by trade policies and the pursuit of cheaper labor, has devastated industries that once supported the middle class, leaving many individuals without stable, well-paying jobs and diminishing opportunities for upward mobility.

The rise of globalization and its impact on domestic industries has contributed to financial instability, with multinational corporations and international financial institutions often prioritizing profits over the well-being of American workers. Additionally, increasing crime rates have eroded the sense of safety and security that is essential for individuals to thrive and pursue a better future. The surge in violence, particularly against women and children, is compounded by deeply ingrained cultural norms brought by some immigrants, which have further strained social cohesion and integration efforts.

Furthermore, the growing unaffordability of quality education has created a significant barrier for many young Americans, limiting their ability to access better job opportunities and financial independence. As tuition costs rise, so does the frustration and disillusionment of those who can no longer see a clear path to success through education. Compounding these struggles, the role of Western media in fostering division and polarization within the nation has created an environment of distrust and animosity, preventing meaningful dialogue and cooperation.

Together, these issues underscore the challenges facing many Americans today. The American Dream, which once felt attainable through effort and perseverance, has become a distant ideal for too many, as economic, social, and cultural barriers continue to grow. Until these systemic problems are addressed, the dream of upward mobility and stability will remain out of reach for a growing segment of the population, leading to a future of deepening division and inequality.

## **Conclusion**

#### Summary of Findings
The American Dream, once a symbol of hope and opportunity, is increasingly out of reach for many due to several interconnected issues. The housing crisis has made homeownership unattainable for many, as prices continue to rise while wages stagnate. The outsourcing of jobs has decimated industries that once supported the middle class, leaving many without stable, well-paying employment. Globalization has further destabilized local economies, while rising crime rates, especially violence against women, have undermined safety and security in communities.

Additionally, the growing unaffordability of education limits opportunities for upward mobility, leaving many young people feeling disillusioned. The media has played a significant role in amplifying societal divisions, contributing to widespread distrust and preventing productive dialogue. Together, these challenges highlight the diminishing reality of the American Dream for many, as economic and social barriers continue to widen.

#### Contribution to the Field
This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the multifaceted challenges facing the American Dream in contemporary society. By examining key issues such as the housing crisis, job outsourcing, rising crime rates, the unaffordability of education, and the role of media in societal division, the paper contributes valuable insights into the complex and interconnected factors that undermine the promise of upward mobility in the United States. Through a nuanced exploration of these issues, this research sheds light on the systemic barriers that prevent many Americans from achieving long-term financial stability and success, offering a more holistic understanding of the decline of the American Dream.

Additionally, the paper’s emphasis on the impact of globalization and cultural ideologies on social cohesion provides a fresh perspective on how external forces, alongside internal socioeconomic challenges, have reshaped the American landscape. The analysis of media's role in amplifying societal divisions contributes to ongoing discussions about the power of information and the ways in which media narratives influence public perceptions. Overall, this research offers an important contribution to the fields of social science, economics, and political science, calling attention to the pressing need for systemic change in order to restore the promise of the American Dream for future generations.
